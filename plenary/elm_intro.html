<h1><span class="section-number">3. </span>Introduction to ELM and workshop scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-elm-and-workshop-scripts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The E3SM Land Model (ELM) is the land surface component of the coupled E3SM model.
ELM simulates a wide set of land surface and ecosystem processes, including surface
energy balance, photosynthesis, carbon allocation, soil and surface hydrology,
nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics, and snow processes, among others.
ELM can be run by itself (if provided meteorological forcing data) or in
different coupling configurations of E3SM. In addition, ELM can be run in point
(e.g., single grid cell), regional, or global configurations.</p>
<p>For this workshop, we have simplified the process of running ELM for several Arctic
sites using a shell script. Several of the new parameterizations added in phase 3 of
the NGEE Arctic project are accessible through this script, as are several ways of
testing the sensitivity of model results to changes in forcing conditions.</p>
<p>If you just completed ‘Step 2. Getting Started’, first open a new Terminal window (Terminal, Cmd + N) and navigate to your field-to-model folder with the following code. For any code blocks starting with ‘docker run’, you should be in your field-to-model directory.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">field</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">model</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see the options that are available for the script by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker run -it --pull always --rm \
    -v  $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
    -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
    -v output:/mnt/output \
    yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex26:models-main-latest \
    /home/modex_user/model_examples/ELM/run_ngeearctic_site.sh -h
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the first example, we will run a ‘control’ case for one of the NGEE Arctic sites where
none of the new capabilities developed for NGEE Arctic have been turned on. There are 9 sites
you can choose from and substitute into the command below at &lt;site_name&gt; (must delete angle brackets):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker run -it --pull always --rm \
   -v  $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
   -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
   -v output:/mnt/output \
   yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex26:models-main-latest \
   /home/modex_user/model_examples/ELM/run_ngeearctic_site.sh \
   --site_name=&lt;site_name&gt; \
   --met_source=&lt;met_source&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command will run three ELM cases (Rosenbloom and Thornton, 2004): a) a spinup with accelerated
biogeochemical cycling (to more rapidly spinup biogeochemical pools), b) a second stage of spinup with
normal biogeochemical cycling rates, and c) a transient run with time-varying CO2 and meteorological forcing
from 1850 to near present (2024 for ERA5, 2014 for GSWP3). In this default configuration, ERA5 meteorological
forcing from dapper will be used, but GSWP3 is available as an option for comparison.</p>
<p>We can open a second shell window (Terminal, Cmd + N for a new window, or Cmd + T for a new tab) and run a second set of cases while this first case is running. As an example, let’s change the initial conditions of the first spinup case. By default, ELM initializes at 274K and at fairly dry soil conditions. A new initialization option, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--use_arctic_init</span></code>, sets wetter and colder initial conditions for the first step (soil column at 70% liquid saturation, and at a temperature varying between 290K and 270K based on <cite>cos(lat)</cite>).</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker run -it --pull always --rm \
   -v  $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
   -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
   -v output:/mnt/output \
   yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex26:models-main-latest \
   /home/modex_user/model_examples/ELM/run_ngeearctic_site.sh --site_name=&lt;site_name&gt; \
   --use_arctic_init --case_prefix=Arctic_init
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After these runs are completed, we can compare the impacts of this initialization choice using the visualization containers.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Note that if you rerun one of these commands, the existing output and case directories for these simulations are removed!
Therefore, if you want to perform a second simulation on a site, you should also set the <cite>–case_prefix</cite> option so that
the case has a different name. In this case, we have set it to “Arctic_init” to distinguish it from our control.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Adding demography and disturbance: ELM-FATES<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-demography-and-disturbance-elm-fates" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>FATES is the “Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator.” It is an optional external module which can run within ELM to include alternative representations of ecosystem processes, namely vegetation demography and dynamic vegetation and disturbance.  FATES is a cohort- and patch-based model of vegetation competition and co-existence, allowing a representation of the terrestrial biosphere which accounts for the division of the land surface into successional stages, and for competition for light between height structured cohorts of representative trees of various plant functional types.</p>
<p>A very detailed explanation of FATES can be found in this <a class="reference external" href="https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/projects/tech-doc/en/latest/index.html">Technical Documentation</a></p>
<p>The source code for FATES, as well as discussion boards, and tracking changes can be found in this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NGEET/fates">GitHub repository</a></p>
<p>For this workshop, we will not go into the details of setting up and running FATES. However, we encourage users to visit previous User Guide documentation, and past <a class="reference external" href="https://fates-users-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">FATES Tutorial documents</a> (the latest tutorial was in Fall 2024).</p>
<p>Here are a few quick instructions and tips for running ELM-FATES:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>FATES will use these same files from ELM: the surface file, domain file, climatology driver data, and ELM parameter file.  The main difference is that FATES has its own parameter file for FATES specific PFT and site level parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Before running FATES we need to generate a parameter file that describes the traits of each Plant Functional Type (PFT) in our simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>A main way to “turn on” the FATES model is through a compset. Example compsets for FATES are IELMFATES or I1850ELMFATES</p></li>
<li><p>There is also a containerized version of FATES using Docker, which was created in 2024.</p></li>

<section id="what-s-going-on-under-the-hood">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.2. </span>What’s going on under the hood?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-going-on-under-the-hood" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The script we have developed simplifies the interface to the Offline Land Model Testbed (OLMT), developed by
Dan Ricciuto (ORNL). OLMT itself simplifies the setup of model cases necessary to spin up an ELM simulation from
a ‘cold start’ condition. (Figure of hierarchy?). OLMT sets up three cases that run consecutively: an ‘accelerated’
decomposition spin up that features accelerated biogeochemical cycling, a second stage of spin up with normal
biogeochemical cycling rates, and finally a transient run that starts in 1850 and continues to near present
(depending on how long the forcing datasets run). OLMT automates the setup of these cases through the E3SM case
control system (CIME - Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth).</p>
<section id="understanding-olmt-e3sm-terminal-output-during-the-run">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.1. </span>Understanding OLMT/E3SM terminal output during the run<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-olmt-e3sm-terminal-output-during-the-run" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>OLMT, and the E3SM cases that it sets up and runs, will both print output to the terminal window while the model is running.
This output can be useful for diagnosing problems with the run, but it can be hard to parse if you are unfamiliar with the model.
In this section, we provide a brief overview of what each section of the output means. (Note: all of the python scripts here
are not directly called in the workshop, but are called by the shell script we have provided. You can learn more about these scripts
by viewing the OLMT links in the additional information sections).</p>
<p>First, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run_ngeearctic_site.sh</span></code> we have provided will print some information about the case being run:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/elm-output-1.png"><img alt="First output stage from ELM" src="../_images/elm-output-1.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>Second, the script configures a call to the OLMT Python script, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site_fullrun.py</span></code>, which sets up and runs the ELM cases. The script we have provided lists all of the arguments that are provided to set up the cases:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/elm-output-2.png"><img alt="Second output stage from ELM" src="../_images/elm-output-2.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>In turn, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site_fullrun.py</span></code> sets up each case with three different calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runcase.py</span></code> which uses settings appropriate for each case, and sets them to run sequentially:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/elm-output-3.png"><img alt="Third output stage from ELM" src="../_images/elm-output-3.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>At this stage, OLMT begins to walk through the CIME scripts that are used to set up and run each case. While there are a lot of details between each step here that can be modified by users, the main steps in using the CIME case management system involve four scripts:
1. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">create_newcase</span></code> - this script sets up a new case directory with the appropriate model components, resolution, and compset (set of E3SM components that are active and how they are configured). This script also creates a case directory.
2. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">case.setup</span></code> - this script sets up the case with the appropriate model parameter files, input data links, user namelist options, and for parallel runs, processor layouts.
3. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">case.build</span></code> - this script compiles the model code for the case (note in the case of OLMT, all three cases use the same executable, so this step is only done for the first case).
4. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">case.submit</span></code> - this script runs the model case.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">create_newcase</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">case.setup</span></code> steps are shown below:</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/elm-output-5.png"><img alt="create_newcase and case.setup output" src="../_images/elm-output-5.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>(Note: in this case, each is specified to run on 1 processor. All of the other domains - e.g., ATM, ICE, OCN - are not active in ELM only runs, and since these ELM runs are only a single grid cell, only one processor is needed.)</p>
<p>The model compiles (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">case.build</span></code>) and the case scripts check to make sure all of the namelists (e.g., a list of options set at runtime that is common in Fortran-based models) are set up correctly:</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/elm-output-6.png"><img alt="Preview namelists" src="../_images/elm-output-6.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>Finally, the model runs:</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2. </span>CIME and configurations of E3SM<a class="headerlink" href="#cime-and-configurations-of-e3sm" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each component of E3SM (e.g., atmosphere, land, sea ice, ocean, land ice) can be configured in different ways depending on the scientific questions being asked. These configurations are called ‘compsets’ (component-sets) and define which components are active in a simulation, and how they are configured. CIME provides the “glue” to help orchestrate compilation and running of coupled (or single model component) simulations. Land-only compsets in E3SM start with ‘I’, and then include components that describe: what time period is being simulated, whether the coupler bypass is being used, what biogeochemistry model is being used (if any, there is also a satellite phenology mode), different models for below-ground decomposition, and whether disturbance and demography (FATES) are enabled.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.1. </span>How different are the meteorological forcing datasets?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-different-are-the-meteorological-forcing-datasets" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We’ve provided two different meteorological forcing datasets: GSWP3 and ERA5. One reason we might look at multiple forcing datasets is that meterological data in remote Arctic settings is often uncertain, so we might want to see how sensitive our land surface model results are to uncertainty in these forcings.</p>
<p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vis_notebooks</span></code> folder, you’ll find a notebook titled 01_compare_met_forcing.ipynb. I’ve shown an example below - this is forcing temperature from Imnaviat Creek, Alaska near Toolik Field Station. Note that while annual means might be similar, GSWP3 seems to be significantly warmer than ERA5 in the spring, but significantly cooler than ERA5 in the fall. What impacts might this have on our simulations?</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/gswp3vsera5.png"><img alt="Comparing two met forcing datasets." src="../_images/gswp3vsera5.png" style="width: 80%;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>Try working through this notebook a few more times - you can change the value of either “site” or “variable” to look at how different these forcing datasets are across the available sites.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-different-are-the-surface-datasets-across-these-sites">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.2. </span>How different are the surface datasets across these sites?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-different-are-the-surface-datasets-across-these-sites" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each surface dataset provided for this workshop is derived from a 0.5° grid from the global model. Because of this relatively coarse resolution, these surface files may not contain the plant communities or land unit types in the abundance that you’d expect with more detailed knowledge of the particular site. We’ve included a quick jupyter notebook that you can use to investigate how the area of this grid cell is partitioned among land units (e.g., lake, wetland, vegetated land) and plant functional types (PFTs - e.g., shrubs, grasses, tree types): 00_inspect_surface_file.ipynb.</p>
<p>Take a look at this notebook - all you should need to change is the “site_name” variable at the top of the notebook to look at different sites. Here’s an example plot of PFT fractions from Abisko:</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.3. </span>Examining case output<a class="headerlink" href="#examining-case-output" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have some completed simulations, let’s take a look at some of the data! In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vis_notebooks</span></code> folder, you’ll find a notebook titled 02_plot_ELM_output.ipynb that shows some examples of plotting timeseries variables, as well as contour plots for 2D variables (e.g,. soil temperature over time). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elm_output</span></code> object shows the variables that are available for plotting:</p>

</figure>
<p>You can learn the long name of the variable, as well as any other metadata assigned to that variable by the model, by clicking on the button in the green square for any particular variable.</p>
<p>Further down you’ll find examples of plotting 1D variables over time as timeseries (these are from a simulation at Abisko, Sweden):</p>
