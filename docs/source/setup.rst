Getting Started
====================

Follow these instructions to set up your environment for the workshop. This
workshop uses Docker containers to encapsulate the models and visualization
tools.

We have pre-built Docker images for the models and visualization tools, which
can be pulled from Docker Hub. However, if you prefer to build the images
locally, instructions are provided in the developer section.

Download Docker containers
----------------------------

The workshop uses two Docker containers: one for running the models and another
for visualization.

Each the model container has the following models installed:

- ELM (Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model)    
- TEM (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model)    
- ATS (Advanced Terrestrial Simulator)

The model container is ~???GB, and the visualization container is ~???GB.
